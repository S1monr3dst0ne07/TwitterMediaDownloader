# Twitter Media Downloader
```
Tool for downloading bulk twitter (im not calling it x, f u elon) media from a user.  
plugin.js runs on the front-end as a user script (i use tampermonkey, idk if it works with other user script managers).  
It collects the media links directly from the browser and sends them to the back-end server.  
server.py runs the back-end server and does the actual url rendering and downloading.  
Im not gonna explain how to use it.  
If you want to use this (which i dont recommend you do), just read the source, it's very small.
